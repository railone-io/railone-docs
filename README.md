#### User deposit
```
url：/api/v1/deposit-transactions
method：POST
```
Card deposit process is not clear for us at the moment. As we were informed, each card will have a cryptocurrency address (e.g. BTC, USDT or ETH address), and to top up the card user must send crypto currency amount to that address. How can we use the API POST /api/v1/deposit-transactions in such flow?

How can we retrieve cryptocurrency addresses, assigned to the card?

When a user sends cryptocurrency to address provided, Your partners receive a cryptocurrency amount, convert it using a rate from coinmarketcap.com, and then send fiat amount to the user’s card. When can we know the finally converted fiat amount, which will be credited to the user’s card: when a cryptocurrency transaction has been registered in the network or when transaction has gained a certain amount of confirmations?

Can we somehow calculate fiat amount, which user will receive on his card, at the moment when user sends cryptocurrency amount?

**A:** Here is how we have we have achieved this. We allocate a cryptocurrency address (e.g. BTC, USDT) for you, "User deposit" is paid with your address. We then calculate the fiat amount and transfer fiat to user card, the query transaction details API is "GET /api/v1/deposit-transactions?acct_no={acct_no}".

- Query a deposit transaction status
```
url：/api/v1/deposit-transactions/{tx_id}/status
method：GET
```
{tx_id} - is a transaction ID on our side (can be value passed in the parameter “cust_tx_id” in the User deposit request POST /api/v1/deposit-transactions) ?

**A:** {tx_id} is not the same as “cust_tx_id”, {tx_id} is in the Railone system when you carry out a deposit.

- Query all the deposit records
```
url：/api/v1/deposit-transactions
method：GET
```
Can we query all deposit records for all our cards using this API method?

**A:** Yes. 

#### Query a particular user's deposit records
```
 url：/api/v1/deposit-transactions?acct_no={acct_no}
method：GET
```
How can we query card’s withdrawal transactions (POS, ATM, etc)? We need them to be displayed in the user's account, in transactions statement.

Can you send callbacks to our server on cards’ withdrawal transactions (POS, ATM, etc)?

Will users receive email / sms notifications about card’s withdrawal transactions (POS, ATM, etc)?

**A:**  Withdrawal transactions can be fetched using "5.3 Check transaction records " API, notifications will be supported in future versions.

```text
url：/api/v1/bank/transaction-record
method：POST
```
 
#### Public API
```
POST /api/v1/emails/{email}/verification-codes
POST /api/v1/mobiles/{mobile}/verification-codes
PUT /api/v1/emails/{email}/verification-codes?code={code}&verification_id={verification_id}
PUT /api/v1/mobiles/{mobile}/verification-codes?code={code}&verification_id={verification_id}
```
Are SMS and Email verification required for our users? If yes, when should we query them, before submitting user's KYC data and card ordering or after?  

**A:** Mobile phone verification is not required. Email verification is optional. If you've carried out validation, you don't need to do it again in Railone. Please refer to "4.1. Sending Email verification code" in API doc for details on how to send the code to user's email.

#### Card’s actual status retrieving. Card blocking / unblocking.

- In the document I can’t find API for card blocking / unblocking and actual card status retrieving. Do you have them? We need to display actual card status in our account and allow users to block/unblock their cards if required. Also our support operators can block/unblock cards by users requests 

**A:** We will support card  blocking / unblocking，but currently have not provided the API for the same in this version. Please ask our business team for details.

#### API to retrieve balance on a card

- In the document I can’t find API for card balance retrieving. Do you have such an API? We need to display actual card balance in the user’s  account

**A:** Please refer to "5.2 Query account balance" API.

- Do you have a test API environment? Can you please provide API URL and credentials?

**A:** Please clarify with our business team.
